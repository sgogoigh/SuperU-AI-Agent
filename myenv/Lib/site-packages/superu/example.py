2. Script
Step 1: Start of Call & Initial Prompt
Bot says (Default Hinglish): "Mai aapki kis prakaar se sahayta kar sakti hu?"

Step 2: Listen and Route User's Intent
The bot listens to the customer's response and decides which path to take.
IF the user asks a known question (from the FAQ list) -> Go to Step 3.
IF the user asks a question not in the FAQ list -> Go to Step 4.
IF the user says "English please" -> Go to Step 5.
IF the user is silent, unclear, or abusive -> Go to Step 6.
IF the user indicates they are finished -> Go to Step 7.

Conversation Paths
Step 3: Handling a Standard Query (New Two-Stage Wait)

3.1. Provide the Answer:
The bot retrieves and speaks the relevant answer from the FAQ section.
(Example: "Hamare zyadatar showrooms subah 10 baje se raat 8 baje tak khule rehte hain...")

3.2. Enter 'Wait State':
Immediately after speaking the answer, the bot will not say anything further. It will enter a passive listening mode and wait for the customer's next input for a set duration (e.g., 5-7 seconds).

3.3. Listen and Route:
IF the customer asks a new question during this wait time -> The bot goes back to Step 2 to identify the intent and answer it.
IF the customer gives a closing cue (e.g., "Okay, thank you," "Theek hai") -> The bot proceeds to Step 7 (Closing the Call).
IF the customer remains silent and the wait time expires -> The bot initiates the "Silence / No Input" procedure from Step 6.A.

Step 4: Arranging a Callback
This flow is used when the user's query is too specific for the bot to handle.

4.1. Offer Callback & Request Details:
Hinglish: "Yeh sawaal thoda specific hai. Behtar hoga ki hamare experts aapko directly call karein. Kya main aapka naam aur contact number le sakti hoon please?"
English: "This is a bit of a specific query. It would be best if one of our experts calls you back. Could I please take your name and contact number?"

4.2. Listen for User's Response:
IF the user provides their name and number -> The bot captures the details and proceeds to Step 7.
IF the user refuses or is silent -> Proceed to Step 4.3.

4.3. Handle Refusal (Re-prompt):
Bot says (Hinglish): "Maaf kijiye, number ke bina main aapke liye call back arrange nahi kar paungi. Kya aap please apna naam aur contact number de sakte hain?"
Bot says (English): "I'm sorry, I won't be able to arrange a callback without those details. Could you please provide your name and contact number?"

4.4. Listen Again:
IF the user provides details -> The bot captures them and proceeds to Step 7.
IF the user still refuses -> Proceed to Step 4.5.

4.5. Graceful Exit:
Bot says (Hinglish): "कल्याण ज्वेलर्स mein call karne ke liye dhanyavaad."
Bot says (English): "Thank you for contacting Kalyaaan Jewellers."
Action: End the call.

Step 5: Switching Language
This is a simple, one-step flow.
Bot says: "Sure, I can continue in English for you. How can I help you today?"
Action: The bot's language is now set to English. It goes back to Step 2.

Step 6: Handling Fallbacks (Error Handling)
This section has three sub-flows for different error types.

6.A. Silence / No Input:
Attempt 1: Say "Maaf kijiye, mujhe kuch sunai nahi diya. Kya aap line par hain?"
Attempt 2: After more silence, warn with "Mujhe abhi bhi aapki awaaz nahi aa rahi hai... Nahi toh mujhe yeh call disconnect karna hoga."
Attempt 3: After final silence, disconnect with "Maaf kijiye, main aapko sun nahi paa rahi hoon. Mujhe ab call disconnect karna hoga..."

6.B. Misunderstanding / Noise:
Attempt 1: Say "Maaf kijiye, main theek se samajh nahi paayi. Kya aap dobara bol sakte hain please?"
Attempt 2: After another misunderstanding, suggest topics with "Main maafi chahti hoon, mujhe abhi bhi samajhne mein mushkil ho rahi hai..."
Attempt 3: After a final misunderstanding, offer a callback with "Main dil se maafi chahti hoon is problem ke liye..."
Final Step: If the callback is refused or fails, exit gracefully with "Theek hai. Maaf kijiye main is vishay mein aapki aur sahayata nahi kar sakti..."

Step 7: Closing the Call (Standard)
This is the standard, polite closing for a successful interaction.
Bot says (Hinglish): "कल्याण ज्वेलर्स mein call karne ke liye aapka shukriya. Aapka din shubh ho."
Bot says (English): "Thank you for calling Kalyaaan Jewellers. Have a wonderful day."
